# Personal Coursework Practices on xArm Automation

## Overview

This repository is a personal collection of my coursework practices focusing on automation with the xArm. It is intended as a reference for my own learning and documentation purposes.

## Prerequisites

- **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.11.8 is installed for compatibility.
- **Virtual Environment**: Utilization of a virtual environment (.venv) is recommended for managing dependencies.

## Installation of xArm Python SDK

To interact with the xArm, the xArm Python SDK is required. Follow these steps for setup:

1. **Clone the SDK**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xArm-Developer/xArm-Python-SDK.git
   ```
2. **SDK Installation**:
   Navigate to the SDK's directory and install using the setup script:
   ```
   cd xArm-Python-SDK
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Network Configuration for the xArm

Ensure the network configuration is as follows to facilitate communication with the xArm:
